# Intro
Pomelo is a minimalistic pomodoro timer, designed to help you focus, breathe, and hone in on the task at hand. The functionality is straightforward: just a timer you can start/stop and reset, as well as a sidebar canvas for tasks and thoughts. The rounds follow a typical pomodoro style, with four 25-minute working sessions separated by 5-minute breaks, and a 20-minute break upon completing the cycle.

# Design Process
I wanted to design a web app that was both inviting and unassuming. One important point was the blinking cursor/autofocus on the task list &mdash; I wanted users to feel prompted to write something as soon as they logged on.
