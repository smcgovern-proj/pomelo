# Pomelo
## Intro
Pomelo is a minimalistic pomodoro timer, designed to help you focus, breathe, and hone in on the task at hand. The functionality is basic: just a timer you can start/stop and reset, as well as a sidebar canvas for tasks and thoughts. The rounds follow a typical pomodoro style, with with four 25-minute working sessions separated by 5-minute breaks, and a 20-minute break upon completing the cycle.
